Cache Architecture Simulator
ðŸš€ A configurable cache architecture simulator for analyzing CPU cache performance under various configurations and workloads.

Features
Supports L1, L2, and L3 cache hierarchy simulation

Customizable cache parameters: size, associativity, block size, and replacement policies (LRU, FIFO, Random, etc.)

Simulates memory access traces for performance analysis

Provides cache hit/miss rates, AMAT, and bandwidth statistics

Implements write-back and write-through policies

Easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI)
